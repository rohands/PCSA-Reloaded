    <!-- Reporting FAQ-->
    <string name="reporting_faq1_header">What is the difference between a Restricted Report and a Standard Report?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq1">
        Both types of reports are confidential in nature. Until you provide Peace Corps with your preference, staff will treat your
        information as if you filed a Restricted Report.\n\n

        A Restricted Report limits your information to only those individuals who have a specific need-to-know that information in order
        to provide you with basic services (medical, mental health, or safety).\n\n

        A Standard Report allows you to access all of the same services offered through Restricted Reporting in addition to other support
        services such as filing a police report, switching host families, and changing to a new site. Because additional services
        may be requested, a Standard Report increases the number of people with a need-to-know.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq2_header">Should I choose Standard or Restricted?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq2">
        The choice between filing a Standard or Restricted Report is an individual one. Some services, however, can only be
        offered under standard reporting. Peace Corps believes it can best support you through standard reporting as it allows
        the agency to leverage additional resources and offer additional services such as conducting an in-depth risk assessment.
        The agency recognizes however that for some Volunteers the most important thing is strict confidentiality and a need for
        as few people to know as possible.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq3_header">What does “need-to-know” mean?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq3">
        A need-to-know means that someone has a specific role that requires basic knowledge about the assault. Only service
        providers typically have a need-to-know and therefore have access to information about the assault as reported by you.
        Only medical staff have information about any medical treatment you receive.\n\n

        A role may be mandated by Peace Corps policies and procedures, US law, or local laws. For example, a Country Director has
        a responsibility to know where each Volunteer is located and new site development requires time and resources managed by
        the Country Director. As such, a Country Director has a need-to-know when a Volunteer requests a site change.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq4_header">What if I change my mind later?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq4">
        All reports start as a Restricted Report. A Volunteer can change from Restricted to Standard at any time. Once a report
        becomes Standard, the report cannot be converted back to Restricted because staff that might help provide additional standard
        report services will have been provided with basic information.\n\n
        Volunteers can request additional services at any time, and Volunteers can discontinue/cancel a request for services at any
        time.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq5_header">Will I get the services/type of reporting I want?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq5">
        Volunteer preferences are very important to Peace Corps. We strive to ensure that Volunteer choices are respected. In
        most cases Volunteers receive all the services they desire. Where something is not possible, Peace Corps staff have a
        responsibility to explain why a service is not possible.\n\n

        Because Peace Corps staff members have a responsibility to protect not only you, but other Volunteers, there may be limited
        situations that require the agency to either disclose your name or convert your report from Restricted to Standard.  This is
        most likely in situations where staff believe there is a serious or imminent threat to your health or safety that Peace Corps
        cannot mitigate without additional support or resources. Conversion of a report without a Volunteer’s consent are very rare.
    </string>

    <string name="reporting_faq6_header">What is a SARL?</string>
    <string name="reporting_faq6">
        A SARL is a Sexual Assault Response Liaison. SARLs are typically Peace Corps staff that have had training in how to support
        people that have experienced a sexual assault. SARLs help Volunteers with issues not handled by the PCMO or SSM. For example,
        a SARL might accompany a Volunteer when traveling to an appointment with a local lawyer.
